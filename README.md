## 👩‍💻 How It Works

Built entirely with **Flutter**, Roomble currently includes:
-  A stylish login page with smooth form validation
-  A cozy home screen greeting you by email (like a digital hug)
-  A “Find a Roommate” button hinting at swipe-based future features
-  A polished and minimalist UI with light branding flair
-  No backend... *yet* — fully frontend and hackathon-ready
